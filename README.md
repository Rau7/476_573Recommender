A project for BIL476/573 Course.

After downloading our files,

You have to download XAMPP for local site. Here a download link : https://www.apachefriends.org/tr/download.html

Find xampp file in your installation path.

Open it and enter the htdocs dir.

Create a directory named bookstore.

Enter bookstore directory and paste downloaded file.

For Database download HeidiSQL from : https://www.heidisql.com/download.php

In HeidiSQL import our bookstore.sql file then we are ready to go!

Run xampp app and click start button for apache.

Enter your browser (Chrome recommended) enter this URL : http://localhost/bookstore/index.php/

You have our website.

This steps are for local website installation. Buying domain and host processes are too long for this project.

Thank you..
